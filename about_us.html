	        			<h1>About Us</h1>
	        			<hr>
	        			<h2>Meet the Owners</h2>
	        			<p>In 1985 Marilyn Rosee and Lisa Davis had an idea. Both were working together as occupational therapy consultants to a group of nursing homes. There were many requests for their services, but only so many hours in the day. They decided to try hiring therapists to work directly for them, filling the positions they were being offered with their own providers. They thought their chances for success were limited, but they decided to try as there was nothing to lose.</p>
	        			<p>Before this turn of events, Lisa was serving as Director of Occupational Therapy at Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center in New York. Marilyn was a Senior Therapist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. While attending New York University pursuing a Master of Public Administration in Health Administration, Marilyn got the notion to go into independent practice. For a few years she was searching for a niche, a viable business idea where her talents as an occupational therapist could be utilized. When the opportunity materialized for Lisa and Marilyn to team up, they both jumped at it.</p>
	        			<p>At first, they continued working at their full time contract positions, spending evenings and weekends interviewing therapists, planning marketing campaigns, and performing bookkeeping tasks. They did everything themselves. Gradually, their business grew.  As modest profits were generated, they were able to rent an office and hire a bookkeeper/office manager to help with the administrative responsibilities. As each year passed, the staff grew along with their business. Now, 25 years later, they look at each other across their "partners" desk, enjoy their panoramic view of New York City and marvel as they watch their many recruiters, managers and support staff busily perform all the tasks that make Therapeutic Resources  work so well.</p>
	        			<p>Through it all, Marilyn and Lisa have maintained their status as "working therapists" by managing occupational therapy departments in long term care and pediatric facilities. Additionally, they have taught in occupational therapy programs, serving as Adjunct Professors at New York University, Long Island University, Touro College, New York Institute of Technology and LaGuardia Community College. They have lectured at many seminars over the years on topics relating to private practice and long term care management and served the local NYS Occupational Therapy  District as Board Members and Co-Chairs of the Geriatric Special Interest Group and the Continuing Education Committee.</p>
	        			<p>After all these years, Marilyn and Lisa look back, with pride at what they have accomplished.  Their company remains a leader in the field of rehabilitation and educational staffing in the New York Metropolitan area.  </p>
	        			<p>They remain committed to their vision and are proud of the reputation they built for fairness, competence and honesty.They remain best friends – in and out of the office – and continue to share a passion for their profession and their company which they worked so hard to create.</p>
	        			<h2>About TR</h2>
	        			<p>Founded by two occupational therapists in 1985, Therapeutic Resources has developed and expanded over the past two and half decades, in response to changes in education and health care for all populations.</p>
	        			<p>Initially founded in response to reimbursement opportunities in the long term care arena at the time, Therapeutic Resources was one of the first agencies established in New York City to provide occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy staff. The passage and expansion of  Public Law 94-142, Education of All Handicapped Children, created greater demand for therapists working in the school system. These two changes in the market created extraordinary opportunities for all therapists and was the basis of Therapeutic Resources initial growth and success.</p>
	        			<p>Through the years we have expanded beyond our expectations, creating five distinct divisions designed to meet the demand for therapists and special educators in the New York City metropolitan area.</p>
	        			<p>The core of our business remains the Rehab Staffing Division, which meets the therapy needs of long term care facilities, hospitals, private preschools and agencies serving developmentally disabled children and adults as well as outpatient facilities.</p>
	        			<p>As approved providers of Early Intervention Services and Service Coordination in New York City and New York State, we serve the needs of young children (newborn to three years) and their families who exhibit or are at risk of developmental disabilities. These services are provided primarily in the child's natural environment.</p>
	        			<p>We have been awarded contracts with the New York City Department of Education to provide occupational therapy and physical therapy services throughout the five boroughs of New York. These services are primarily provided in the child's school.</p>
	        			<p>Our Preschool Program, regulated by New York State and New York City, provides related services (occupational, physical and speech therapy), Special Education Itinerant Teachers (SEIT) and Multi Disciplinary Evaluations (MDE) to children ages three to five.</p>
	        			<p>The Seminar Division at Therapeutic Resources provides continuing education courses designed to enhance and improve the skills of our providers, as well as the therapeutic and educational community at large.</p>
	        			<p>We continue to search for ways to improve and expand our services in order to meet the therapy and educational needs of the populations we serve, and the providers who deliver care to our clients.</p>
